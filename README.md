# Repository for the DOT Camera Viewer Application

🌐 Website: https://highpingg.github.io/DOT-Camera-Viewer/

Web application that allows viewing of DOT traffic cameras.

Currently this is a static site without a backend server. It uses the APIs published by various Departments of Transportation from different states, cities, and counties. I see no need for a backend server currently, but am open to hosting one in the future should the need arise. As of now, I only have camera viewing for NYC working, but am planning on adding more in the future. I am also open to adding cameras from other agencies if allowed.

Pull requests are always welcome!
